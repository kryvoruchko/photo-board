1. I didnâ€™t do error handler (that would take more time but it can be actually done)
2. Also there is an option to move methods in controller outside into separate server and use them out of there.
3. I made the draft (pictures) state is saved on server in order there is an opportunity to continue work with it during page reload. I could set it on front end only but in this case data would be lost during reload. 
4. I wanted to divide the content into two different apps but the task condition was to combine all into one.

## Running app

Run `npm install` and `npm run start`.
